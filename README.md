# YouTube Downloader

**WARNING: this is just a test**

This is a simple Flask application that allows you to download YouTube videos and playlists as mp3 files.

## Install

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ryddle/ytdownloader.git

2. Navigate to the application directory:
   ```bash
   cd your_repository

3. Create a virtual environment (optional):
   ```bash
   python -m venv env

4. Install the dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt

5. Run the application:
